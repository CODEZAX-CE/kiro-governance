# Project Progress

## Phase 0: Discovery & Compliance

- [x] 0.1 Project type determined — **Greenfield (App Dev)** (confirmed by human 2026-06-10)

### Open Questions (Phase 0)

- ✅ **RESOLVED — GitHub Agent mechanism:** Architect decision — **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/governance-trigger.yml`). Triggers on commit/merge when `project-progress.md` changes; processes macro-gate entries only. Micro events logged directly by sub-agents via MCP server. Resolved in SRS v1.1, confirmed in architect review round 2.

- [x] 1.4 SRS approved — architect approved SRS v1.4, zero Critical/High issues (2026-06-10) - OQ-01: One Slack webhook per project channel ✅ - OQ-02: project_id = GitHub repository name (e.g. `rainn`, `icvics`) — customer decision Tariq Khan 2026-06-11 ✅ - OQ-03: Dashboard = Amazon QuickSight via Athena federated query ✅ - OQ-04: Secrets = SSM Parameter Store ✅ - Cost revised to ~$25–30/mo (QuickSight ~$12 + Athena ~$5 added)
